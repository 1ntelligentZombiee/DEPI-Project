## Key Highlights
1. Malware Analysis
   - Explored various malware types, such as viruses, worms, Trojans, ransomware, spyware, and more.
   - Compared detection methods: signature-based, behavior-based, static, dynamic, reputation-based, and hybrid approaches.
   - Case studies on DarkComet (Remote Access Trojan) and CryptoLocker (Ransomware).

2. SIEM Configuration
   - Designed a network with Elastic Stack components for centralized logging and threat detection.
   - Integrated firewalls and agents to monitor endpoints and generate alerts.
   - Developed custom rules based on the MITRE ATT&CK framework to identify and prevent threats.

3. Prevention Strategy
   - Created a layered approach including:
     - Patch management
     - Endpoint protection
     - Network segmentation
     - Secure email gateways
     - User training and awareness programs

4. Awareness Materials
   - Included interactive materials such as:
     - *Infographics*: Visual guides on malware prevention.
     - *Awareness* Videos: Educational content for users.
     - *Games*: Cybersecurity escape room simulation for engagement.
